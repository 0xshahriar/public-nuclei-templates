# Public nuclei-templates
These are the public nuclei templates that are available on the internet ( actually on github ) .

## Credit :
I would like to thank [Emad Shanab](https://github.com/emadshanab/) for his awesome collection of [nuclei-templates](https://github.com/emadshanab/Nuclei-Templates-Collection). I just updated his list. Nothing else. 

## To those persons who are sharing their templates,
The newcomers will be benefitted by your job. Sharing is caring. So, keep sharing like these. May Allah give you success in return. 🎉
